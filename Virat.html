<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Virat Kohli (born November 5, 1988, Delhi, India) is an Indian international cricketer considered by many as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of the game. Kohli plays for (and previously captained) the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) in the Indian Premier League (IPL). He is also a former captain of the Indian cricket team in all three international formats—Test cricket, one-day internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 internationals (T20I)—making him one of India’s most successful captains.

Kohli has earned praise for his discipline and commitment from teammates, opponents, and cricket veterans alike. “He has changed the face of cricket and how you prepare for the game. The discipline that he has stands out, always,” cricketing great Brian Lara said of Kohli after Kohli was named Player of the Tournament for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.

<h2>My Opinion</h2>
<p>
My opinion about Virat Kohli's performance is same as always. He is a world-class batsman and better than the best batsman of each side in a team. He has shown his powerful hitting capabilities and even his calm attitude by hitting 250 runs in a match. But sometimes, the things are not in your control.</p>
